### Treeroots is a complete WIP

Please don't expect anything of it - it's my hobby game.  

At the moment, I'm using require.js to lead modules - the main module being src/main.js. 

### So where are you going with this?

For the short-term, I wanna get to an arcade monster masher.

### Can I play?

Sure - [head over here](http://hughfdjackson.github.com/treeroots) to play the game, whatever state it's in.
