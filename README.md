#### Treeroots is a complete WIP

There's no how-to, or read-me, or whatever.  If you're interested in the sourcecode, look at src.

Otherwise, [play the damn thing, in whatever state it's in](http://hughfdjackson.github.com/treeroots)


### Why 'Treeroots'?

Cause you're underground.

I know, genius, right?

I was just born that way, don't feel bad.
