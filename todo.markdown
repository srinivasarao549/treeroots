# TODO LIST

This is more of an immediate TODOs; I know I'm going to need collision/music/etc eventually.

## Current

## Tech

* 'shadow' in src/game(i.e. lets you see where an object was last frame)
* Add a "kill" handler
* Iso tile sheet
* Named layers and in-layer depth-sorting
* Layer parallax quotient
* Draw offset from camera

* TESTS AND CLEANUP

## Creative
* simple menu screen
* simple loading screen
* Iso tileset
* Play around with how the movement of the char should go - still wasd in iso?
