# TODO LIST

This is more of an immediate TODOs; I know I'm going to need collision/music/etc eventually.


## Tech

* Fade up/out on the whole level
* 'shadow' in src/game(i.e. lets you see where an object was last frame)
* Replace timer with flywheel.
* Write tests for image preloader

## Creative

* Need design docs.
* Need to think about art
