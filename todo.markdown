# TODO LIST

This is more of an immediate TODOs; I know I'm going to need collision/music/etc eventually.

## Current

* Tile map behaviour

## Tech

* Better movement behaviours
* Fade up/out on the whole level
* 'shadow' in src/game(i.e. lets you see where an object was last frame)
* Replace timer with flywheel.
* Write tests for image preloader + clean it up (massively)
* Spritesheet animation behaviour
* Particle generation system 

## Creative

* simple menu screen
* simple loading screen
* Need design docs.
* Need to think about art
* How strong a character should there be?

## Game design recommendations

* For balancing, check out nethack
